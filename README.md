# Homework 2: Stars
Working with your partner, you will have 4 problems to write computational essays for this week. Like last time, please make sure you export the essay as a _standalone_ HTML file, and please name them according to the problem number.

Data for all the problems is contained within the `/data` folder, and are simple CSV files of stellar spectra. Note though that for problem 3 you will need to unzip the CSV file, as it was too large otherwise to fit in the GitHub repository.
