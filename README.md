# Homework 2: Stars
Working with your partner, you will have 4 problems to write computational essays for this week. Like last time, please make sure you export the essay as a _standalone_ HTML file, and please name them according to the problem number.

Data for the first two problems is contained within the `/data` folder, and are simple CSV files of stellar spectra. Data for the last two problems will be to large to upload here to GitHub and thus you'll have to download it separately through the link provided in the assignment.

Due: February 17, 2023
